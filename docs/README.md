# AI Governance Platform

A comprehensive AI governance solution for Financial Services Institutions (FSIs) that helps integrate AI governance processes into existing business workflows including Model Risk Management, AI Oversight, Data Governance, Data Residency, and ISO standards compliance.

## 🎯 Overview

The AI Governance Platform provides a complete suite of tools to manage AI system governance throughout their lifecycle. Built specifically for financial services, it addresses regulatory requirements while providing practical governance capabilities.

### Key Features

- **🏛️ Model Risk Management**: Comprehensive model validation, performance monitoring, and risk assessment
- **👁️ AI Oversight**: Decision logging, transparency reporting, audit trails, and escalation procedures
- **📊 Data Governance**: Data quality monitoring, lineage tracking, privacy compliance, and lifecycle management
- **🌍 Data Residency**: Location compliance monitoring, cross-border transfer validation, and sovereignty management
- **📋 ISO Standards Compliance**: Support for ISO/IEC 23053, 23901, 23094, and other relevant standards
- **⚙️ Workflow Orchestration**: Automated governance processes, approval workflows, and integration capabilities

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Register an AI System

```python
from ai_governance import GovernanceFramework

governance = GovernanceFramework()

system_info = {
    "name": "Credit Risk Model",
    "use_case": "credit_scoring",
    "model_type": "gradient_boosting",
    "data_types": ["pii", "financial"],
    "data_sensitivity": "high",
    "jurisdictions": ["us", "eu"]
}

result = governance.register_ai_system("credit_model_v1", system_info)
print(f"Registered with governance level: {result['governance_level']}")
```

### Run Compliance Assessment

```python
assessment = governance.assess_system_compliance("credit_model_v1")
print(f"Overall compliance score: {assessment['overall_score']}")
print(f"Status: {assessment['status']}")
```

### Model Validation

```python
validation_data = {
    "type": "comprehensive",
    "score": 87,
    "performance": {"accuracy": 0.89, "precision": 0.86},
    "validator": "third_party"
}

result = governance.model_risk_manager.validate_model("credit_model_v1", validation_data)
```

### Workflow Orchestration

```python
from ai_governance import WorkflowOrchestrator

orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator()

workflow = orchestrator.initiate_workflow("compliance_assessment", {
    "system_id": "credit_model_v1"
})
```

The platform supports extensive configuration for different environments and requirements:

```python
config = {
    "model_risk": {
        "validation_threshold": 80,
        "monitoring_frequency": "daily"
    },
    "data_governance": {
        "quality_threshold": 85,
        "retention_period": "7_years"
    },
    "data_residency": {
        "default_region": "us-east-1",
        "allowed_regions": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
    }
}

governance = GovernanceFramework(config)
```
